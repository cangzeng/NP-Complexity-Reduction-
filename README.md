These papers collectively establish novel quantum-geometric frameworks that achieve ​polynomial-time complexity​ for discrete NP problems. Central breakthroughs include:

​Quantum Ordinal Mapping​ (Docs 1–2) embedding NP problems into algebraic structures (ideal class groups/recursive ordinals), reducing complexity to O(n1.01) via Hamiltonian eigenspace compression.
​Geometric Quantum Optimization​ (Docs 4–5) using Riemann surfaces/toric bundles to encode 3-SAT/TSP, collapsing search spaces via curvature-driven dynamics (O(n1.05–O(n1.8)).
​CFT/Fractal-Zeta Frameworks​ (Docs 3,8) leveraging rigid conformal constraints and fractal dimensionality (DH) to compress solutions to O(log2n) or O(n1.02).
​Categorical Isomorphisms​ (Docs 6–7) linking ideal class groups to TQFTs via p-adic Hodge theory, enabling arithmetic-quantum memory with 99% fidelity.
